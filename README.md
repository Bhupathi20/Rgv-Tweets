Hello and welcome to the README for the "Tweet like RGV" project!

This project uses Buildspace and OpenAI's API to generate tweets in the style of the famous Indian film director Ram Gopal Varma (RGV). By using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, we are able to imitate RGV's unique voice and create tweets that sound like they were written by him.

To use this project, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. Once you have these, you can clone the repository and run the code locally on your machine. and the number of tweets you want to generate. The program will then use OpenAI's API to generate the tweets and you can post them on twitter

We hope you find this project fun and useful for imitating RGV's unique style on Twitter. If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue on this repository or contact us directly.

Happy tweeting!
